## Details



The Genome Data Management Core subsystem is designed to be the central hub for managing genomic and gene-related metadata within the project. It ensures data integrity, provides structured access to genomic resources, and facilitates the integration of custom gene annotations.



### Genome Registry Manager

This component is responsible for the core operations of managing genome assembly metadata and associated files. It handles the registration, updating, and retrieval of genome information, including file paths, checksums, and metadata. It also performs data validation against defined schemas and integrates with the gene metadata management for comprehensive data integrity. This component acts as the primary interface for interacting with the stored genome reference data.

### Gene Metadata Processor

This component focuses on the detailed management and processing of gene-level metadata. It defines the schema for gene models (exons, transcripts, CDS) in YAML format and provides utilities to validate and potentially transform this data into standard bioinformatics formats like GTF. It's a critical part of ensuring that user-defined or external gene annotations are correctly structured and integrated into the overall genomic data landscape.
